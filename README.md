# Project-BlackSheep
Project blacksheep is a project i started to study and share the amount and current cyber attacks on the web, this repo helps mitigate bad actors and includes:
- Bad ipv4 Addresses captured via honeypot
- Malware Samples captured via honeypot for further analysis (I am not held responsible for what ever happens to you or your servers/computers/network)
- Malformed Get and post requests and raw logs from an apache honeypot
- Common credits used for attacking servers
- Unque user agent string reporting for Bots and Crawlers (check UAS)
I deployed the lists using pfblockerNG on pfsense 2.4.5-devel.
If you would like to report a false positive or a issue please make a issue request.
